# slid

**slid** is a simple, 12-byte (96-bit) lexicographically-sortable identifier encoder for Go that embeds a nanosecond-resolution timestamp with a 32-bit atomically-incremented counter value. In other words, it generates IDs. Which are small. And probably unique (usually 2.14e22 unique identifiers per millsecond). And maybe usable.

Lexicographically-ordered IDs can be quite useful for key/value stores like [LMDB](https://symas.com/offerings/lightning-memory-mapped-database/) and [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) in situations when you'd like for values to be time-sorted. The identifiers generated by **slid** sacrifice human readability for performance and identifier size versus, for example, RFC 3339-encoded timestamps.

## Getting Started

If you've installed Go and set your GOPATH, just:

    go get -u github.com/boatilus/slid

Import the package in your project:

    import "github.com/boatilus/slid"

And from there, *slide* into generating some *slids* ⛷️

    id := slid.New()                    // constructs a new SLID struct with the current time
    encodedID := id.Encode()            // returns a []byte
    decodedID := slid.Decode(encodedID) // returns a SLID struct
    
### Benchmarks

    BenchmarkNew-4             	50000000	        30.2 ns/op
    BenchmarkEncode-4          	30000000	        34.7 ns/op
    BenchmarkNewThenEncode-4   	30000000	        52.3 ns/op
    BenchmarkDecode-4          	100000000	        10.9 ns/op
    
(Run on a 2.7 GHz Haswell Core i5)

### Running the tests

To run the tests, you'll need to `go get` testify/assert:

    go get -u github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
    
Then run command in the `slid` directory:

    go test -v
